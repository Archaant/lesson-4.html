                    <center><p style="font-size: 25px; color:rgb(15, 106, 34)">This is a Paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
                            and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. Attributes and styles can 
                            be used for paragraph's.</p>
                    </center>

                    <center><p style="font-size: 25px; color:rgb(15, 106, 34)">This is another Paragraph. 
                            Now you can see the before and after margin (white space) of the first paragraph.</p>

                    <center><p style="font-size: 25px; color:rgb(15, 106, 34)">This is also a paragraph with long sentences about AI. 
                            Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transitioned from a futuristic concept to an integral part of contemporary society, 
                            influencing various sectors including technology, healthcare, finance, and daily life. The journey of AI from 
                            theoretical discussions to practical applications highlights its transformative impact and the profound implications 
                            it holds for the future. The roots of AI can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with pioneers such as Alan Turing 
                            and John McCarthy laying the foundational theories and terminology. Turing's work, particularly his concept of 
                            the "Turing Test," posed fundamental questions about machine intelligence and its capacity to exhibit human-like 
                            reasoning. The term "artificial intelligence" was coined in 1956 during the Dartmouth Conference, marking the 
                            formal beginning of AI research. Early AI research focused on symbolic AI, where intelligence was perceived as a 
                            set of rules and logical operations. Despite initial optimism, the limitations of this approach led to periods of 
                            reduced funding and interest, known as "AI winters." These periods of stagnation were followed by renewed enthusiasm 
                            as researchers developed new techniques and computational power advanced.</p>

                <center><p style="font-size: 25px; color: rgb(15, 106, 34)">Now you can see clearly the white space between each paragraph. 
                        You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
                        With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
                        The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.</p>

                        <center><p style="font-size: 25px; color: rgb(8, 46, 215)">The &lt;hr&gt; tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, 
                        and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. The 	&lt;hr&gt; element is used to separate content (or define a change)
                        in an HTML page. The horizontal lrules (lines) can be seen in the upcomeing 3 paragraphs.</p></center>

                        <center><p style="font-size: 25px; color: rgb(32, 243, 8)">The HTML element defines a line break. 
                                Use if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph. In this paragraph you have four 
                                sentinces without HTML line breaks. In the following paragraph you will see the same sentences with 
                                HTML line breaks</p></center>

                        <center><p style="font-size: 25px; color: rgb(217, 55, 136)">The HTML &lt;pre&gt; element defines preformatted text.
                                The text inside a &lt;pre&gt; element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), 
                                and it preserves both spaces and line break. In the next paragraph we will give a demonstration.</p></center>

Faith is wisdom.
Faith is power.
Faith is heart-fragrance.
Faith is the sun-child Of the Beyond.
